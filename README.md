# Project 1: The Elevator interface

## For a B:

### Common Uses 
    - The main function of an elevator is to transport people between floors
    - This means that the floor buttons are the most important for passengers
    - Buttons to make the travel between floors faster are secondary
    - A button to communicate with an employee should hopefully never be used, however it important to have that functionality in case something does go wrong

### Sequence 
    - After a user it enters the elevator it is assumed they will press the button of the floor they wish to go to
    - They may or may not hit the door open of door close, depending on external circumstances
    - All users picked up
 along the way have the same options as the first user
    - If the elevator stops working the user will press the bell button to speak to an employee

### Design
    - The main floor buttons are in the center of the screen and ordered left to right
    - The less commonly used buttons are laid out clearly at the bottom of the screen
    - After a button is pressed a red light is displayed around the chosen button
    - There is a small LCD screen that displays the current floor
    - Due to the “G” an “L” buttons this elevator format will only work in a hotel with previous knowledge of a garage and lobby 

### Defense of Control Interface
    - A small amount of area between the commonly used buttons and less commonly used buttons
    - The garage button is the first button as it is the lowest floor
    - The lobby button replaces the first floor as it would be previously known that there is a lobby
    - The two button is the first numbered floor as it is the second story and one floor above the lobby

## For an A; 

### Size
    - The control interface is 500×750 pixels, small enough to fit on almost all touch screen devices and large enough to be seen clearly on 1920×1080 screen.
